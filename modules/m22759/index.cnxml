        <item>In the same way that trade was the driving force behind the journeys of discovery that were undertaken by Diaz and Da Gama, it is still the main reason why people travel from one place to the other. One group disposes of products/services that the other group needs to acquire. Regular communication between the groups facilitates the execution of the trade transactions.</item>
        <item>Transport takes place by road, sea or air. The central trading centres are located in large cities, and for that reason the main transport routes are between these cities.</item>
